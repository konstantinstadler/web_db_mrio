 This Environmental Footprints Explorer and its contents reflects simple, open-source calculations based on publicly available MRIO databases. A huge amount of work goes into constructing these databases and we would like to thank the scientific groups and consortiums building these databases for adhering to an open science/data framework.
 
 The use of the data included in the Environmental Footprint Explorer means the acceptance of the terms of use of the databases providing this data (OPEN:EU, EXIOBASE, WIOD, EORA). Users are referred to the respective database homepages for further information. The results presented here are a (near as possible) harmonization of environmental impact categories across the databases. Notwithstanding, results displayed in the Environmental Footprints Explorer platform are based upon these aforementioned databases, but any calculation errors are the responsibility of the developers of this web platform.
