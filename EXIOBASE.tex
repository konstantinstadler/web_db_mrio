\subsubsection{EXIOBASE}


EXIOBASE is a global EE MRIO aiming to support analysis of technologies,
policies, and standards in relation to EU sustainability policies. The
environmental focus of the database reflect in a high level of detail in the
agriculture, energy, mining, trans- port, and waste management sectors. In
addition, EXIOBASE provides satellite accounts for over 300 environmental
interventions.  

The database was developed and analysed in three consecutive EU projects (cite
EXIOPOL, CREEA, DESIRE). The current version, EXIOBASE 2, implements the
economic and environmental accounting principles proposed in the UN System of
Economic and Environmental Accounts (SEEA, European Commission et al. 2012).
The ongoing development of EXIOBASE 3 concentrates on providing a time series
of EE MRIOs and now-casting this time series to the current year. 

Currently, EXIOBASE consists of EE MRIOs for 26 (27 in the upcoming version 3) EU countries
and 16 major economies in industry and industry (163 sectors) as well as
product by product (200 sectors) classification.
