\subsubsection{2.2.3 Eora}


Eora is a time-series (1990-2011) of input-output tables with high country detail (187), utilising assymetric levels of detail and concepts of supply-use. There is further a smaller version of Eora at 26 sectors common for all countries. The total database has 15,909 sectors with the size of the system having just over 250 million variables. The database has 35 types of environmental indicators covering air pollution, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, Ecological Footprint, and Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity. A key point of the Eora database is its inhomogenous classification in the full detail version.
