Calculation of EE MRIO accounts (Multipliers, Footprints, impacts embodied in trade, etc) followed
standard IO methodology. We used the open source tool pymrio (https://github.com/konstantinstadler/pymrio) for the calculations.

All results are  calculated through input-output analysis (IOA) following classic Leontief demand style modeling. IOA is essentially an allocation of production based impacts (here denoted $\textbf{F}$) to the goods and services that flow to final demand (here denoted $\textbf{y}$). The allocation starts from the basic production balance, where gross output $\textbf{x}$ is the sum of total intermediate demand $\textbf{T}$ (with $\textbf{1}$ being the summation vector of appropriate size) and final demand. 

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}=\textbf{T}*\textbf{1}+\textbf{y}
\end{equation}

Normalising intermediate production (to produce one unit of output, we can calculate the required inputs, giving the technical coefficient matrix $\textbf{A}$)

\begin{equation}
\textbf{A}=\textbf{T} * \textbf{x}^{-1}
\end{equation}

Then we can combine the above two equations, using what has been known as the Leontief inverse ($\textbf{L} = (\textbf{I}-\textbf{A})^{-1}$), to estimate the total output ($\textbf{x}$) for any given demand $\textbf{y}$:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}=\textbf{L} * \textbf{y}
\end{equation}

In MRIO modelling, for a certain demand, in a certain country, the production required to satisfy the demand is calculated. The point of departure from national accounting in gross domestic product terms is that imports are endogenised in the flows of goods to demands, and exports are excluded from a country’s demand – in line with gross national expenditure calculations. Environmental inputs or emissions of economic production can be linked to the input-output table through a stressor (environmental intervention) matrix $\textbf{F}$. Similar to the basic input-output relationship, environmental intensities (environmental factors per unit production, $\textbf{S}$) can than be calculated:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{S} = \textbf{F} * \textbf{x}^{-1}
\end{equation}

In order to calculate overall upstream impacts (aka footprints $\textbf{D}$) due to a certain demand $\textbf{y}$, we utilize the Leontief Inverse $\textbf{L}$ as per standard input-output analysis:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{D} = \textbf{S} * \textbf{L} * \textbf{y}
\end{equation}

Direct emissions of final demand $\textbf{Fhh}$ (e.g. gas cooking or fuel consumptions) are handled separately and added to the calculated $\textbf{D}$.
