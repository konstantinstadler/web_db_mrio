The results of the calculation were then exported into csv files and imported
in an sql database using phpMyAdmin tool. The development of the web-based user interface was done using wordpress developer's platform. The tool for the data exploration was developed in a shortcode methodology
which makes it transportable.

In the shortcode script the server-side scripting was done in php while the user interface for the data exploration tool was developed in html. The querries for the retrival of data were done using sql in combination with the wpdb class provided from wordpress. Interactive graphics were developed with google visualization api and javascripts.
