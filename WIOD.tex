\subsubsection{WIOD}

The World Input Output Database (WIOD) was also constructed as an alternate tool for analysing the effects of globalisation on trade patterns,
environmental pressures and socio-economic development on a global level \cite{timmer_world_2012}. WIOD consists of a time series (1995â€“2011) of IOT for 27 EU
countries, 13 non-EU countries, and 1 RoW region. WIOD distinguishes 35
industries and 59 products. The WIOD has prioritized aggregate accounts as consistent as possible with official statistics. The database has been used extensively to analyse fragmentation of supply chains and trade in value added.
