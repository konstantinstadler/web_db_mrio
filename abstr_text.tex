Environmentally extended Multi Regional Input Output tables and analysis (EE MRIOs) have emerged as one of the main tools to analyze resource use and environmental impacts across international supply chains. They provide insights into the life cycle impacts of the production and consumption of commodities world wide, taking into account the global supply chain of purchased commodities.

Currently half a dozen EE MRIO databases are available which differ in their environmental and economic focus as well as in the level of detail. As these databases become increasingly large, it has become increasingly difficult for the non-input-output expert to access the most important attributes and results of basic calculations.

Here we present an unifying web-platform, the Environmental Footprints Explorer, designed to access indicator results calculated based on these databases. The main functionality of the web-platform include (1) in detail exploration of a single database (2) comparison between databases using a common classification system and (3) exporting analysis results and API access to these.

The presented web-platform removes the obstacle for policy-makers and the public alike to access EE MRIO results.
