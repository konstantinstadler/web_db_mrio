The Environmental Footprints Explorer provides a consistent way to access environmental accounts of different EE MRIO databases and also to compare these results across databases.

The implementation of the Environmental Footprints Explorer allows to easily extend the number of EE MRIO databases accessible. In the short term, all EXIOBASE versions, WIOD and the aggregated EORA system will be integrated.
