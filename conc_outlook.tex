In the next couple of month, we plan to extend the number of EE MRIO included in the comparison. The upcoming update of EXIOBASE to version 3 (February 2016) will be included in the web-platform providing the first now-casted EE MRIO results. In addition, we will contact other EE - MRIO database providers to discuss a potential inclusion of their data into the unified web-platform.
