The overall goal of the Environmental Footprints Explorer is to deliver the newest environmental accounting results to policy makers and the public. Previously, these data was filtered by the analyst of the databases and often restricted to the top level results considered novel enough for a scientific publication. Detailed data or the newest updates of previously published data may still be hidden in the databases, although they could be critical for informing targeting policy development.

Recently, the European Science Policy (http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/open-science-open-access) as well as various scientific journals \cite{Hanson_2011, Stodden_2012, Boulton_2012} committed to a open science and data scheme. We feel, that, in an ideal situation, open science should not only provide open access to the raw data used for any analysis, but also provide a way to utilize the data for non-experts. The Environmental Footprints Explorer represents a first step in that direction.
