Some recent studies analyzed the differences between EE MRIO databases \cite{Stadler_2014, Owen_2014, Moran_2014}. These studies provided important background information on the reasons of the observed differences and some exemplified comparisons on the effect of the differences of indicators. In order to get the amount of difference for other indicators, any practitioner would need to redo the whole study, starting from parsing several EE MRIO databases, aggregating to a common system and re-analyze the indicator results. 

The proposed web-platform provides an alternative approach. The comparison of the EE MRIO databases is readily available through the user interface as is the access to the detailed results.
