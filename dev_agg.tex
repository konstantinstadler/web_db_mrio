In order to compare the different EE MRIOs included, we aggregated each into the Common Classification System \cite{Steen_Olsen_2014}. This system comprises the common denominator for all EE MRIOs available and leads to an aggregation to 41 regions (40 countries and 1 Rest of the World) and 17 sectors. Due to the European focus of most EE MRIO projects, the Common Classification includes all European Union countries (except the new member state Croatia).
