The rest of the article unfolds as follows. In the next section we give some background information on environmental accounting followed by an overview about recently published EE MRIO databases which are included in the Environmental Footprint Explorer.
The development section describes the architecture of the web platform, the routines used for calculating the results and the Common Classification System \cite{Steen_Olsen_2014} applied to the MRIOs in order to make them comparable.
We then present the platform and highlight some use cases. We conclude with a description of the future development.
