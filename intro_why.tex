Evidence guided policy making aiming for lessening the negative environmental and social impacts of our society require a comprehensive accounting principle. Such a principle must not only take into account direct domestic emissions and resource usage but also make the connection across global production networks - ultimately we are often interested in what forms of consumption have driven the impacts caused in production processes.

Global Environmentally Extended Multi Regional Input-Output (EE MRIO) tables provide such an system by taking into account the interrelations between production and consumption. 

During the last years, several EE MRIO databases have been published \cite{Tukker_2013}. These databases differ in their environmental and regional focus and also due to the applied accounting principles and implementation details \cite{Stadler_2014, Owen_2014, Moran_2014}.
