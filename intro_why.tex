Evidence guided policy making aiming for lessen the environmental and social
impacts of our society require a comprehensive accounting principle. Such an principle must not only take into account direct domestic emissions and resource usage but also make the connection to the consumption ultimately causing the production.

Global Environmentally Extended Multi Regional Input-Output (EE MRIO) tables provide such an system by taking into account the interrelations between production and consumption. 

During the last years, several EE MRIO databases have been published \cite{Tukker_2013}. These databases differ in their environmental and regional focus and also due to the applied accounting principles and implementation details \cite{Stadler_2014} \cite{Owen_2014} \cite{Moran_2014}.
