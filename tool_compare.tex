\subsection{Comparing accounts across databases in a common classification}

The main problem in any EE MRIO comparison is the sector and accounting
mismatch between the databases. To solve that issue, we aggregated every
database into a common classification (for sectors and regions) and
selected environmental interventions common to all databases included.

This approach follows Kjartan - check.
Ongoing work, expected to be finalized in April.
