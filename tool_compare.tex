\subsection{Comparing accounts across databases in a common classification system}

The main problem in any EE MRIO comparison is the sector and accounting
mismatch between the databases. To solve that issue, we aggregated every
database into a Common Classification System \cite{Steen_Olsen_2014}. 

Leaving the model field in the selection unspecified allows to compare results across databases. 
In addition, we compiled one additional database based on the average results of all included MRIOs.
