\subsection{Comparing accounts across databases in a common classification system}

The main problem in any EE MRIO comparison is the sector and accounting
mismatch between the databases. To solve that issue, we aggregated every
database into a Common Classification System \cite{Steen_Olsen_2014}. 

Leaving the model field in the selection unspecified allows to compare results across databases. 
In addition, we compiled one additional database based on the average results of all included MRIOs.
As such, the Environmental Footprints Explorer provides a consistent way to access environmental accounts of different EE MRIO databases and to compare these results across databases.

The implementation of the Environmental Footprints Explorer allows to easily extend the number of EE MRIO databases accessible. In the short term, EXIOBASE 2, WIOD, EORA and OPEN:EU  have been integrated. We plan to extend the list of available MRIO as further databases become publicly available.
