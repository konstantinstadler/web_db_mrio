\subsection{Visualization and exporting}

The table view in the Data Explorer provides several possibilities to export the data: The data can be either copies to clipboard, or exported as excel, csv or pdf file. All export functions work on the currently specified dataset-view. 

The Environmental Footprint Explorer provides several interactive visualization functions. 

In order to compare total impacts per country, a bar chart can be generated. This chart includes the total amount of impact/stressor for each country and for each specified model. For trends over time, line plots are available. 
For example, the Green House Gas Emission of China vs USA can be plotted over time for both, the consumption based (footprint) as well as production based accounting scheme. Again, this plot can also be used to assess differences between databases.
