\subsection{Downloading results and API}

The data extracted in the two use cases described above gets presented in a table (Figure \ref{fig:table}) together with a visualization (Figure \ref{fig:bar}). Both items can be downloaded (as csv file and png graphics).

In addition, the web-interface also provides an full API access to the databases. 

\textbf{Draft Note: The API access will be implemented in May and will be available at the time of the presentation. We plan to include a supplement describing the API commands to access the database and to exemplify  an use case here.}
