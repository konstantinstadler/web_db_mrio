\subsection{Exploring environmental accounts based on a single database}

The first choice in the Data Explorer of the Environmental Footprint Explorer allows to specify a certain EE MRIO model. 
Within one MRIO model, several parameters can be selected (Figure \ref{fig:select}), including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Base-year
    \item Stressor (environmental/social) intervention or factor of production, impacts
    \item Countries/regions
    \item Sector of the database (industry, product or final demand category)
    \item Perspective (Footprint, production/territorial accounts, embodied
      stressors in imports and exports, Multipliers and Intensities)
\end{itemize}

Based on the selection of the table of accounts gets updated and can be sorted as required (by each column). The length of the table can be adjusted and a search box allows to find entries within the table.
