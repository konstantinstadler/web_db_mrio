\subsection{Viewing EE MRIO accounts based on a specific database}

Users can specify one of the freely available EE MRIO databases. 
Within a database, several parameters can be selected (Figure \ref{fig:select}). These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Countries/regions available in the selected database
    \item Sector of the database (industry, product or final demand category)
    \item Environmental/social intervention
    \item Year
    \item Perspective (Footprint, production/territorial accounts, embodied
      pressures/impacts in imports and exports, Multipliers and Intensities)
\end{itemize}


The general idea behind the selection is that the user specifies four out
of five parameters and gets an overview of remaining parameter.

For example, choosing the database EXIOBASE for 2007 and specifying export accounts for the perspective, CO_2 as the environmental intervention, and air transport service as sector result in a result list showing these paramters accros regions (the undefined parameter, see Figure \ref{fig:table}).
