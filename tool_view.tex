\subsection{Viewing EE MRIO accounts based on a specific database}

Users can specify one of the freely available EE MRIO databases. 
Within a database, several parameters can be selected. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Countries/regions available in the selected database
    \item Sector of the database
    \item Environmental/social intervention
    \item Year
    \item Perspective (Footprint, production/territorial accounts, embodied
      pressures/impacts in imports and exports, Multipliers and Intensities)
\end{itemize}


The general idea behind the selection is that the user specifies four out
of five parameters and gets an overview of remaining parameter.

For example, if selecting TODO: put in two examples together with
screenshots of the result.
